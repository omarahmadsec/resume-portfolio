# ðŸ§­ Personal Mission Statement â€“ Omar Ahmad

As an aspiring cybersecurity analyst, my mission is to protect digital systems by combining technical expertise with real-world simulations, threat intelligence, and continuous learning. 

My focus is on Blue Team operations â€” particularly in Security Operations Center (SOC) environments â€” where I aim to detect, respond to, and prevent cyber threats using tools like SIEM platforms, log analysis, and scripting. I take a hands-on approach, building my own SOC simulation environments and developing custom tools to understand how real attacks unfold and how defenders can stop them.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing cybersecurity certifications (Google Cybersecurity Certificate, CompTIA Security+) and working on public projects that reflect my passion for defensive security. My long-term goal is to become a cybersecurity engineer who can design, secure, and defend infrastructure across enterprise systems.

I believe cybersecurity is not just a career â€” itâ€™s a responsibility, and Iâ€™m committed to staying sharp, ethical, and impactful in everything I build and protect.
