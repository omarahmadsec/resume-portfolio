Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the [Cybersecurity Intern / SOC Analyst Intern / Entry-Level Security Role] position at [Company Name]. As a student actively pursuing a career in cybersecurity, I bring a strong foundation in Blue Team concepts, hands-on experience with log analysis and alert generation, and a passion for securing digital infrastructure.

I have independently built and documented my own Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation project, where I replicate real-world multi-step attack scenarios and generate AI-enriched alerts. This project demonstrates my ability to investigate incidents, develop detection logic, and work with tools such as SIEMs and Python scripts. I also maintain a public GitHub portfolio that includes security tools, TryHackMe reports, and automation scripts — all of which showcase my practical learning approach and commitment to growth.

I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and am currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification. My skills include Windows and Linux environments, Python automation, and an understanding of core defensive security principles. I am eager to apply these skills in a collaborative, fast-paced security team where I can continue learning and contribute to protecting organizational assets.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be excited to discuss how my enthusiasm and growing expertise can benefit your team. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Sincerely,  
Omar Ahmad
